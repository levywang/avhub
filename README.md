## Getting Started  

### Run Locally  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/levywang/avhub.git  
cd avhub  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
python main.py  
```  
The default API address: `https://api.wwlww.org/`  

You can configure a reverse proxy and domain, replacing `BASE_URL` in line 38 of `web/script.js`.  

The backend configuration file is located in `data/config.yaml`. Modify it according to your actual needs.  

### Docker Deployment  
**Note: Python Version >= 3.7**  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/levywang/avhub.git  
cd avhub  
docker run -d -p <your_server_port>:80 -v $PWD:/app --name avhub levywang/avhub:latest  
```

### **Configuration Instructions**  

If you deploy the project on a server within China, the source site `missav` is blocked, so you need to configure a proxy server in `config.yaml`. Edit the `/data/config.yaml` file and modify it as follows:  
```yaml
av_spider:
  source_url: "https://missav.ai/cn/search/"
  proxy_url: "http://192.168.50.3:7890" # HTTP or SOCKS5 proxy
  use_proxy: true
```

### **Technology Stack**  
- **Frontend**:  
  - Built with **Tailwind CSS** for a modern, responsive interface.  
  - Integrated with **hls.js** for smooth video playback.  
- **Backend**:  
  - Developed using **FastAPI**, a Python framework, to provide efficient and stable API services.  
- **Privacy Protection**:  
  - Strictly adheres to privacy principles and does not directly host any resource files. All data is retrieved through third-party links.  

---

### **Data Sources**  
- **Magnet Links and Cover Images**: Sourced from **missav**.  
- **Hacg Resources**: Sourced from **hacg liuli**.  
- **Random Video Recommendations**: Sourced from crawled data stored in the local file `/data/video_urls.txt`.  

The above data sources are configured in `/data/config.yaml`. If the data sources change or become inaccessible, modifications and maintenance are required.
